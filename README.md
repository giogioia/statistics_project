Statistical hypothesis tests and comparitive analysis of machine learning models performance

In this project we performed various dual and multiple statistical hypothesis tests on Italian firms financial wellbeing using [AIDA dataset](https://www.bvdinfo.com/it-it/le-nostre-soluzioni/dati/nazionali/aida). 
We eventually implemented different machine learning models to predict the probability of business failure and we performed comparative statistical analysis to assess significant performance differences among the models.

All data exploration tasks, statistical tests and model fitting was performed using R on RStudio.
